        "# Getting Started with ArangoDB Interactive Notebooks\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provides instructions and examples for creating interactive tutorial notebooks for ArangoDB. If you have a cool project you would like to share or a concept that you think the community might enjoy, please create a notebook and submit a PR.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook covers:\n",
        "* How to generate a free temporary database\n",
        "* Installing and using the python driver \n",
        "* Importing data \n",
        "\n",
        "## Getting Connected\n",
        "\n",
        "### Temporary database\n",
        "Our notebooks use a Foxx microservice to generate a temporary database and you can use it as well. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Hosted for Free\n",
        "We offer the endpoint hosted on Oasis to use for free, the URL to use for that is https://tutorials.arangodb.cloud:8529/_db/_system/tutorialDB/tutorialDB. \n",
        "\n",
        "When making a notebook be sure to include `tutorialName`(as shown below) if you use the endpoint.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Local\n",
        "Alternatively, you can test and create your own notebooks using the foxx service locally by simply zipping the `foxx_service` directory in the root of the [interactive-tutorials repository](https://github.com/arangodb/interactive_tutorials) and installing in your local ArangoDB instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Oasis.py\n",
        "The `oasis.py` package is used to manage the session and helps to ensure the database is ready before proceeding with opening any connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Python Driver\n",
        "There are two python drivers created and maintained by our wonderful community and you can use the one your prefer. The two most popular python drivers are:\n",
        "* [pyArango](https://github.com/ArangoDB-Community/pyArango)\n",
        "* [python-arango](https://github.com/joowani/python-arango)\n",
        "\n",
        "By default `oasis.py` uses pyArango but as demonstrated below you can also use python-arango by using `oasis.connect_python_arango()` instead of the default `oasis.connect()`. \n",
