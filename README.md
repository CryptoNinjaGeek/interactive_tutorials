# ArangoDB Interactive Tutorials

![ArangoDB-Logo](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/assets/arangodb_logo_2016_inverted.png)

Here you will find tutorials and interactive notebooks for ArangoDB features. These notebooks allow you to learn about ArangoDB concepts and features without the need to install or sign up for anything. Each notebook uses a free temporary tutorial database that lets you focus on all the cool things ArangoDB has to offer.

## Learn

### Machine Learning
In addition to the notebooks listed in the following section, we have example machine learning notebooks with [ArangoML](https://github.com/arangoml), including:
* [ArangoML Pipeline](https://github.com/arangoml/arangopipe/tree/master/examples)
* [ArangoDB NetworkX Adapter](https://github.com/arangoml/networkx-adapter/tree/master/examples)


### ArangoDB 
These notebooks are interactive and take the hands-on learning approach, so feel free to play around and change things. Each notebook provides an intoduction to its covered topics along with the ability to immediately see it in action. 

Most notebooks were developed with Google Colab in mind and many have an [![](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](#) button.

## Contribute

Do you have a great idea for a notebook? 
Did you see something you think could be better?
Have a cool project that uses ArangoDB that you would like to share with the community?

Make a notebook of your own!

We have provided a template that will help you quickly get started creating a notebook that can also generate a temporary database for fellow learners.

Just open up the [Template.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/arangodb/interactive_tutorials/blob/master/Template.ipynb) file to learn more about what it takes to get started or you can use the [Template_basic.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/arangodb/interactive_tutorials/blob/master/Template_basic.ipynb) file to get a simple notebook with only the connection code done for you.

Once your notebook is ready for the world to see, you can place it in the [community_notebooks](https://github.com/arangodb/interactive_tutorials/tree/master/community_notebooks) folder and create a pull request.
